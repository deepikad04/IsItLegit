The math is unforgiving — a 50% loss requires a 100% gain just to break even.\n\nThe golden rule: never risk more than 5% of your total capital on a single trade.

This survival-first approach keeps you in the game through inevitable losing streaks.\n\nCalculation: If your stop-loss is 10% from entry, and you risk 1% of capital ($100), then your position size is $100 ÷ 0.10 = $1,000. This tells you exactly how much to buy.\n\nKey insight: Position sizing isn't about being conservative — it's about being mathematical.",

Because diving feels like doing something. Standing still feels like giving up.\n\nInvestors have the same bias. When markets move, we feel compelled to act — buy something, sell something, DO something. But the data is clear: most retail traders would have better returns if they traded LESS frequently.\n\nAction bias is especially dangerous in volatile markets. Each trade has costs (fees, spread, taxes) and emotional consequences (regret if wrong, overconfidence if right). The best traders are comfortable doing nothing when conditions don't match their strategy.\n\nThe rule: 'No trade is a trade.' Choosing not to act IS a decision — often the best one.",

This prevents emotional, impulsive decisions during critical moments.\n\nCreate your own pre-trade checklist:\n\n1. Have I waited at least 20 seconds since the last market event?

What's my exit plan if this goes wrong? (Prevents hope-based holding)\n5. Is this position sized correctly? (Prevents overexposure)\n\nIf you can't answer YES to all five, the trade isn't ready. This isn't about being slow — it's about being systematic. Speed without a system is just gambling.",

Use them to:\n\n• Read all news headlines and understand the narrative\n• Check social sentiment — what are others doing?\n• Watch the initial price action — is it trending or choppy?\n• Form a thesis BEFORE looking at the buy/sell buttons\n\nThe data from our simulations shows that users who wait 20+ seconds before their first decision score 30% higher on process quality than those who act within 10 seconds.
